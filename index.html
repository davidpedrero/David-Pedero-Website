  <h1>David Pedrero</h1>
  <h2>David Pedrero was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1996. Born to two Latino immigrant parents, not much was expected of him other than to work, get married and raise a family. However, defying all expectations, and against all odds, he rose to become recognized as one of the best comedians of all time.</h2>
